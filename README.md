# GCP Resource Management System

## Overview
The GCP Resource Management System is a collection of shell scripts designed to streamline the management, analysis, and optimization of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources. The system includes utilities for logging, error handling, resource analysis, pattern detection, debugging, and testing. It is modular, extensible, and aimed at developers and system administrators managing complex GCP environments.

## Features
### Core Modules
1. **gcp-utils.sh**
   - Provides foundational utilities for logging, error handling, resource state management, and locking mechanisms.
   - Includes retry mechanisms, exponential backoff, and comprehensive error recovery.

2. **gcp-error-handler.sh**
   - Manages error reporting and recovery across all components.
   - Includes stack trace generation and integration with centralized monitoring.

3. **gcp-resource-analysis.sh**
   - Analyzes GCP resource usage to identify underutilized resources, anomalies, and optimization opportunities.
   - Generates actionable reports to help reduce costs and improve performance.

4. **gcp-pattern-detection.sh**
   - Detects patterns and anomalies in resource usage.
   - Supports predefined and user-defined patterns for greater flexibility.

5. **gcp-debug-info.sh**
   - Collects and compiles diagnostic data for debugging.
   - Supports user-defined exclusions to protect sensitive information.

6. **gcp-test-suite.sh**
   - Validates the functionality and stability of the system.
   - Includes unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.

## Current Status
This project is currently in **pre-stable development**, with no official stable version released yet. The immediate goal is to finalize version **3.2.6**. The focus is on stabilizing core functionality, improving modularity, and enhancing error handling and testing.

### Seeking Contributors
We are actively seeking contributors to help:
- Stabilize version 3.2.6.
- Refine existing modules.
- Expand test coverage.
- Optimize performance and logging.

## System Requirements
- **Google Cloud SDK** (`gcloud`)
- `jq` (JSON processor)
- `awk` (text processing)
- `bc` (arithmetic processing)
- `curl` (HTTP requests)
- `mktemp` (secure temporary file creation)

### Supported Platforms
- Linux
- macOS
- Other Unix-like systems

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gcp-resource-management.git
   cd gcp-resource-management
   ```

2. Ensure all required commands are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install gcloud jq awk bc curl mktemp
   ```

3. Initialize the environment:
   ```bash
   ./gcp-utils.sh --initialize
   ```

## Usage
### Example Workflow
1. **Analyze Resources:**
   ```bash
   ./gcp-resource-analysis.sh --project my-gcp-project
   ```

2. **Detect Patterns:**
   ```bash
   ./gcp-pattern-detection.sh --input resource-data.json
   ```

3. **Debug Issues:**
   ```bash
   ./gcp-debug-info.sh --exclude-auth
   ```

4. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   ./gcp-test-suite.sh --run-all
   ```

### Key Command-Line Options
- `--initialize`: Sets up the required directories and initializes the system.
- `--project`: Specifies the GCP project for analysis or testing.
- `--exclude-auth`: Excludes sensitive authentication data from outputs.

## Roadmap
### Version 3.2.6 Milestones
- **Stabilize gcp-utils.sh**
   - Finalize logging, error handling, and locking mechanisms.
- **Enhance Test Suite**
   - Add edge case tests for different project categories.
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Improve Documentation**
   - Provide detailed examples for each module.
   - Add troubleshooting guides for common issues.

### Future Enhancements
- Support for multi-cloud environments.
- Advanced pattern detection with machine learning.
- Integration with external monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or fix.
2. Write clear and concise commit messages.
3. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.
4. Ensure your code passes all tests by running the test suite locally:
   ```bash
   ./gcp-test-suite.sh --run-all
   ```

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure all required commands are installed.
- **Permission Denied Errors:** Verify that the script has access to the required directories.
- **Timeouts:** Check resource locks and adjust timeout values in the configuration.

### Debugging
Run the debug module to collect diagnostic information:
```bash
./gcp-debug-info.sh --output debug-report.zip
```
